== Examples

This section contains some stand-alone script examples of how you can use `HttpBuilder`. You can copy them and run them in
the Groovy Shell or there are unit test versions for most of these examples in the `ExamplesSpec.groovy` file.

=== Resource Last Modified (HEAD)

Suppose you want to see when the last time a jar in the public Maven repository was updated. Assuming the server is exposing
the correct date, you can use the `Last-Modified` header for the resource to figure out the date. A `HEAD` request works
nicely for this, since you don't care about the actual file content at this time, you just want the header information.
HttpBuilder-NG makes this easy:

[source,groovy]
.resource_last_modified.groovy
----
@Grab('io.github.http-builder-ng:http-builder-ng-core:0.17.0')

import static groovyx.net.http.HttpBuilder.configure
import groovyx.net.http.*

String uri = 'http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/codehaus/groovy/groovy-all/2.4.7/groovy-all-2.4.7.jar'
Date lastModified = configure {
    request.uri = uri
}.head(Date) {
    response.success { FromServer resp ->
        String value = FromServer.Header.find(
            resp.headers, 'Last-Modified'
        )?.value

        value ? Date.parse(
            'EEE, dd MMM yyyy  H:mm:ss zzz',
            value
        ) : null
    }
}

println "Groovy 2.4.7 last modified ${lastModified.format('MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm')}"
----

In the example we use the URL for the Groovy 2.4.7 jar file from the Maven Central Repository and execute a `HEAD` request on
it and extract the `Last-Modified` header and convert it to a `java.util.Date` object and return it as the result. We end up
with a resulting output line something like:

    Groovy 2.4.7 last modified 06/07/2016 03:38

Alternately, using header parsing along with the `java.time` API, you can simplify the header conversion:

[source,groovy]
.resource_last_modified_alt.groovy
----
@Grab('io.github.http-builder-ng:http-builder-ng-core:0.17.0')

import static groovyx.net.http.HttpBuilder.configure
import static java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern
import groovyx.net.http.*
import java.time.*

ZonedDateTime lastModified = configure {
    request.uri = 'http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/codehaus/groovy/groovy-all/2.4.7/groovy-all-2.4.7.jar'
}.head(ZonedDateTime) {
    response.success { FromServer resp ->
        resp.headers.find { h->
            h.key == 'Last-Modified'
        }?.parse(ofPattern('EEE, dd MMM yyyy  H:mm:ss zzz'))
    }
}

println "Groovy 2.4.7 (jar) was last modified on ${lastModified.format(ofPattern('MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm'))}"
----

which yields the same results, just with a cleaner conversion of the header data.

=== Scraping Web Content (GET)

Scraping content from web sites doesn't seem to be a prevalent as it was years ago, but it's a lot easier than it used to be.
By default, `text/html` content is parsed with the https://jsoup.org/[JSoup] HTML parser into a `Document` object:

[source,groovy]
.web_scraping.groovy
----
@Grab('io.github.http-builder-ng:http-builder-ng-core:0.17.0')
@Grab('org.jsoup:jsoup:1.9.2')

import static groovyx.net.http.HttpBuilder.configure
import org.jsoup.nodes.Document

Document page = configure {
    request.uri = 'https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.codehaus.groovy/groovy-all'
}.get()

String license = page.select('span.b.lic').collect { it.text() }.join(', ')

println "Groovy is licensed under: ${license}"
----

In the example we make a `GET` request to the a secondary Maven repository to fetch the main entry page for the `groovy-all`
artifact, which has the license information on it. The page is returned and parsed into a JSoup `Document` which we can then
run a CSS selection query on to extract the license information and display it. You will end up with:

    Groovy is licensed under: Apache 2.0

=== Sending/Receiving JSON Data (POST)

Posting JSON content to the server and parsing the response body to build an object from it is pretty common in RESTful
interfaces. You can do this by creating a POST request with a "Content-Type" of `application/json` and a custom response
parser:

[source,groovy]
.sending_receiving_post.groovy
----
@Grab('io.github.http-builder-ng:http-builder-ng-core:0.17.0')

import static groovyx.net.http.HttpBuilder.configure
import static groovyx.net.http.ContentTypes.JSON
import groovyx.net.http.*

@groovy.transform.Canonical
class ItemScore {
    String item
    Long score
}

ItemScore itemScore = configure {
    request.uri = 'http://httpbin.org'
    request.contentType = JSON[0]
    response.parser(JSON[0]) { config, resp ->
        new ItemScore(NativeHandlers.Parsers.json(config, resp).json)
    }
}.post(ItemScore) {
    request.uri.path = '/post'
    request.body = new ItemScore('ASDFASEACV235', 90786)
}

println "Your score for item (${itemScore.item}) was (${itemScore.score})."
----

The custom response parser is needed to convert the parsed JSON data into your expected response data object. By default, the
`application/json` response content type will be parsed to a JSON object (lazy map); however, in this case we want the
response to be an instance of the `ItemScore` class. The example simply posts an `ItemScore` object (as a JSON string) to the
server, which responds with the JSON string that it was provided.

The additional `.json` property call on the parsed data is to extract the JSON data from the response envelope - the site
provides other useful information about the request. The end result is the following display:

    Your score for item (ASDFASEACV235) was (90786).

=== Sending Form Data (POST)

Posting HTML form data is a common `POST` operation, and it is supported by `HttpBuilder` with a custom encoder, such as:

[source,groovy]
----
@Grab('io.github.http-builder-ng:http-builder-ng-core:0.17.0')

import static groovyx.net.http.HttpBuilder.configure
import static groovyx.net.http.ContentTypes.JSON
import groovyx.net.http.*
import static groovy.json.JsonOutput.prettyPrint

def result = configure {
    request.uri = 'http://httpbin.org'
    request.contentType = JSON[0]
}.post {
    request.uri.path = '/post'
    request.body = [id: '234545', label: 'something interesting']
    request.contentType = 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
    request.encoder 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', NativeHandlers.Encoders.&form
}

println "You submitted: id=${result.form.id} and label=${result.form.id}"
----

which posts the specified form data to the `http://httpbin.org/post` which replies with JSON content containing the posted
form data (along with some other information). The default JSON decoder is used to parse the JSON content into a multi-level
Map, from which we can extract the data we sent.

Note that the `NativeHandlers.Encoders.&form` encoder is used to convert the provided map data into the encoded message
before sending it to the server.

=== Download File (GET)

HttpBuilder-NG provides a utility to aid in downloading files from HTTP endpoints. An example of this would be the case where your server has a file
served up from the `/download` path - you could download this file with something like the following:

[source,groovy]
----
File file = configure {
    request.uri = "http://example.org/download"
}.get {
    Download.toFile(delegate, saved)
}
----

Which uses the `groovyx.net.http.optional.Download` class `toFile(HttpConfig, File)` method to perform the downloading by providing a means of
streaming the remote contents into the file. See the docs for the `Download` class for more options and details - the unit test, `DownloadSpec` also
has some good usage examples for this functionality.

=== Configuring Timeout

You can provide additional configuration not directly supported by `HttpBuilder`, such as connection timeout, using the
`clientCustomizer(Consumer<Object>)` method (supported by all three client implementations):

For the `apache` client:

[source,groovy]
----
HttpBuilder http = ApacheHttpBuilder.configure {
    client.clientCustomizer { HttpClientBuilder builder ->
        RequestConfig.Builder requestBuilder = RequestConfig.custom()
        requestBuilder.connectTimeout = 1234567
        requestBuilder.connectionRequestTimeout = 98765

        builder.defaultRequestConfig = requestBuilder.build()
    }

    // other config...
}
----

and for the `okhttp` client:

[source,groovy]
----
HttpBuilder http = OkHttpBuilder.configure {
    client.clientCustomizer { OkHttpClient.Builder builder ->
        builder.connectTimeout(5, MINUTES)
    }

    // other config...
}
----

and lastly, for the `core` client:

[source,groovy]
----
HttpBuilder http = OkHttpBuilder.configure {
    client.clientCustomizer { HttpURLConnection conn ->
        connection.connectTimeout = 8675309
    }

    // other config...
}
----

This additional custom configuration must be applied with care, as it is possible to undo the configuration provided by the `HttpBuilder` library.
